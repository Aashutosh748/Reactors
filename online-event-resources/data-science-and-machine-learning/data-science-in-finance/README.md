# A Financial Data Lifecyle

The code in this folder follows the stream from July 16th (YouTube recording coming soon). 

# Resources
During the stream we built a notebook using some stock data:
- [stocks.ipynb notebook](/online-event-resources/data-science-and-machine-learning/data-science-in-finance/stocks.ipynb)
- [Data](/online-event-resources/data-science-and-machine-learning/data-science-in-finance/Data): You only need the .zip file
- [Data originally from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse#prices-split-adjusted.csv)

To get started, you will need to make sure you setup your Data Science environment. We recommend using Visual Studio Code:
- [Setup Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E3WMb8_T3s&list=PLlrxD0HtieHjDop2DtiCmwTTcrlwKAVHE&index=8)

This stream is an extension of the Developer's Introduction to Data Science video series which is 1.5 hours in length over 28-videos:
