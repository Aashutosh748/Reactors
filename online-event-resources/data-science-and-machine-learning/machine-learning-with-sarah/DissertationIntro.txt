As technology and connectivity become more prevalent we continually get closer to true ubiquitous computing (Wieser) envisioned. Instead of technology becoming the focus of interaction it is my goal to push forward research that allows technology to perform background tasks, allowing the hardware to get out of the way so that people can accomplish their tasks without constantly needing to break their concentration to interact with a device. Data generation comes hand-in-hand with the realization of Wieser's dream. We have long known that to perform ubiquitous computing well data about user context must be computed, additionally, for best results data from each interaction can be stored long term to be used as training data for future encounters with the technology. The resulting data is very useful for learning about how computers should adapt to better serve users, but often lacks utility at the individual level. If each user is contributing personal data to a system, it stands to reason they should receive some individual benefit for their contribution. 
The area of Personal Informatics, sometimes called the Quantified Self movement, looks at how to support individual value from data collection. 
While many individuals involved in the movement collect and analyze data through purposeful methods (such as custom sensors and hand written data logs), there are many sensors now that are readily available and often already in the possession of lay technology users. Recent developments in smart phones have made activity detection possible without the need for additional sensors. The recently discontinued Google Latitude offered a free service where users could track their location paths over time by running a background process on their phones. It also provided summaries of how much time is spent by users in different locations such as home and work, and keeps a running total of how many flights a user has taken in the past year.  The initial idea for personal informatics is that studies have shown that humans are very bad at generalizing their behavior. Through the collection and analysis of data Personal informatics aims to bring this invisible knowledge to the forefront so that an individual can gain a better sense of their own behavior. Automatic data collection is a big part of what has made this level of collection and aggregation possible, as it lowers the barrier for who can, and is willing to, participate as a data collector. Mobile data collection and aggregation services such as Nike run keeper, Fitbit and Jawbone have lowered the barrier to personal sensing and brought personal data collection to the mainstream. 
In my research I explore how to push this idea further by looking at the interpersonal nature of data collection. While this data can be used introspectively to gain insight about one's own life, very little is understood about how this data could be used to support and facilitate connection between individuals. This idea is inspired by face-to-face interaction where non-verbal information is often shared between people who are in close proximity to one another. This type of interaction, called implicit interaction, is a key part of what allows individuals to feel connected. While this works well in collocated scenarios, it remains surprisingly unsupported for people living at a distance. My goals in this research were to:
Explore existing methods for implicit distance connection, to learn about current practices, limitations, and desires.
Develop a prototype system as a probe to support truly implicit distance connection through deployment with real users.
Explore how meaningful sharing changes within larger user groups through the deployment of a community-scale data collection and sharing system.
In this dissertation I will show how sharing automatically collected data can support connection and communication between individuals and communities. Perhaps, most importantly, proving that automatically collected data can support relationships and is valuable beyond the individual user. The following sections detail the important concepts for work in this space: Implicit communication, reciprocity, and sensor supported distance interaction.
Human communication supports feelings of connectedness with the communities and individuals that we care about most. Interpersonal interactions fall into one of two categories; explicit communication and implicit communication.
Explicit communication   - Purposeful interaction engaged in with the purpose of communicating. Example explicit communication interactions include: Face to Face conversations, Phone Calls, Text messages, and Facebook status updates.
Implicit communication   - Non-purposeful data transfer that occurs as a byproduct of actions of yourself or an other. Example implicit communication interactions include: brushing past a loved one in the hallway, hearing the lock turn in the front door, or hearing your spouse laugh while sitting on the couch watching a movie together.
These two classes of communication together help individuals form feelings of connection and intimacy.  In their study of proximate and mediated intimacy Kjeldskov et al. define eight aspects of intimacy that together support feelings of human connection between romantic couples [Kjeldskov]. These are: 
Physical Intimacy  --Feelings of closeness supported by physical touch. 
Non-verbal Communication  --Communication that is better supported through a means other than voice (eg. touch, gesture, facial expression).
Self-Disclosure--A deep sense of connection supported by the sharing of close personal feelings.
Presence  --Feelings of closeness supported by non-structured, ambient observation made possible by being proximate to one another.
Cognitive Intimacy--``Characterized by the feeling of `knowing' the other'' Understanding their likes and dislikes, their personal preferences and being able to anticipate their reactions to different scenarios
Affective Intimacy--A deep sense of affection, caring, and love toward the other individual. Affective Intimacy is often used to differentiate between romantic relationships and close friendships.
Commitment--Long-term intent of remaining in the relationship.
Mutuality  --A communal sense that both parties are striving towards the same goals as a team.
Kjeldskov argues that ``it is important to note that these components do not exist or work independently, nor do they individually satisfy the intimate experience. Indeed, the themes overlap greatly and are highly interrelated.'' Although these traits work together to support feelings of intimacy existing communication technologies focus on self-disclosure, which is but a single aspect of these pillars of connection. Several, research attempts have been made to understand and support computer mediated non-verbal communication like textual and haptic emoticons (walther emoticons, haptic augmentation for phone conversations), while others have investigated methods for supporting physical intimacy at a distance (all that work about bed sharing and such). In this work I explore computer mediated implicit communication through supporting remote presence and encouraging mutuality.
In technology design we have done a good job of replicating explicit interactions for distance communications, but technologies that support implicit communication have largely been overlooked, especially int he commercial sector.
When differentiating between Explicit and Implicit communication one marker is especially evident. In explicit communication there is effort exerted by the producer that is reciprocated in kind by the receiver. This reciprocal interaction is a concrete way that both parties acknowledge the exchange of communication. While this may be obvious for common communications such as synchronous conversation, it is has also been observed in asynchronous communication like text messages [teen gift giving Harper]. The threshold for creating reciprocity in computer mediated communication lies in the perception of intent and crafting [Jofish click paper]. When the recipient perceives effort was excerpted on behalf of the sender feelings of reciprocity are generated by the interaction. A well known case of low effort reciprocity is the Facebook "poke wars" where users would feel obligation to click the "poke" button in response to their friend "poking" them. Although the ''poking'' represents a very low effort task that is devoid of message crafting (eg. simply clicking a button), the need to reply in kind was widely felt by users [].
This reciprocal form of communication and connection is foundational to interpersonal connection and often form the basis for more complex social structures, from small scale tribal structures [The Gift], to large scale modern interactions, such as interactions on Facebook. One simple way classify implicit verses explicit interaction is through the presence of reciprocity.
Even in minimalist interactions the effects of reciprocity are still felt, as evidenced in [Kaye's] work where click wars we observed, and in a larger scale through Facebook "poke wars". Although minimal action was taken on the part of the sender (clicking a button), recipients still felt the need to acknowledge the receipt by responding in kind. 
Reciprocity (Quote from Sahlins)   Economic imbalance is the key to deployment of generosity, or generalized reciprocity, as a starting mechanism of rank and leadership. A gift that is not yet requited in the first place ``creates a something between people'': it engenders continuity in the relation, solidarity--at least until the oblation to reciprocate is discharged. Secondly, falling under ``the shadow of indebtedness,'' the recipient is constrained in his relations with the giver of things. The one who has benefitted is held in a peaceful, circumspect, and responsive position in relation to his benefactor. (1972 p.208)
Malinowski introduces the idea of a continuum or reciprocities with barter at one end and ``the true gift'' at the other.
Continuum of Reciprocities (Quote from Malonowski)   It seems possible to place reciprocities based on the ``vice-versa'' nature of exchanges, along which empirical instances encountered in the particular ethnographic case can be placed   .
Taylor and Harper extend the idea of reciprocity to include digital exchanges, and the sharing of digital objects. In their study digital exchanges on teenage social structure they found evidence of different social value attributed to different artifacts, often linked either to effort, monitory cost (such as free vs. paid for text messages), and sharing to establish trust [Taylor, Harper]. The exchange of virtual commodities such as text messages, Facebook pokes, and ``likes'' generated imbalances in feelings of reciprocity which propagate similarly to their traditional, more physically grounded, cousin.
Kaye explores the limits of this reciprocity by looking at how minimal interactions still garner these feelings. In his study of long distance romantic couples, he found that even when minimal effort was extorted o behalf of the other feelings of reciprocity were still generated[Kaye]. This suggests that it is the perceived exertion of directed effort that promotes these feeling of reciprocity in computer mediated relationships. This speculation is further supported by journalistic contributions[articles about Facebook games] noting the ever morphing social norms on systems like Facebook where the the cardinal sins seem to center around breeching reciprocity (posting content that does not create an imbalance because it provides not value to the reader, either because it is generated, generic, or lacks directness).
For the purposes of this dissertation we will focus particularly on interaction in that thin slice of interactions where feelings of reciprocity are not generated. This kind of interaction must lack intent and crafting on the side of the sender, while artfully avoiding generating feelings of resentment on behalf of the recipient associated with spam.
While reciprocity traditionally has been attributed to the exchange of physical ``gifts'' recent research has explored the parallel social practice surrounding virtual gift-giving (Taylor and Harper).

The role of implicit communication
Implicit communication is critical to human connection. 
Implicit connection relies on physical presence, and historically there was no way to support implicit communication at a distance. In recent times researchers have explored how harnessing sensing technologies can support this kind of communication, exploring presentations such as ambient presence lights, soundscapes, synced objects, and smells. While these projects illustrate important steps forward in supporting implicit connection through ambient awareness, they all share the limitation that they are bound to the place where they are installed, whether that be a home or office. In my research I aim to explore how these kinds of communication can be explored in a ubiquitous setting. In my research I have found that a large portion of time is spent in contexts where permanent installations are not possible, such as friend's houses, public transport, or public places such as restaurants or grocery stores. While these locations may be out of the user's control for permanent installations, they are places where mobile devices are accepted and expected. As the proliferations of smart phone increases it is reasonable to harness this platform for supporting mobile implicit communication. The findings from previous studies can be adapted and expanded for this case. For example, there are new limitations concerning the method of information delivery. In a mobile public setting we can not rely on the user's eyes to be available for information retrieval, and generating sounds may also be inappropriate. Working within these constraints leads to interfaces which are distinct from those explored by previous studies where the context of the user was known.
For the first time in history we can make this kind of communication available on the go and at a distance.
Earlier work has looked at ambient awareness, but focusses on stationary displays. While these do accomplish supporting feelings of connection at a distance, their scope and usage is still limited because once one travels out of range of the display they are returned to an environment where implicit communication is not supported. The goal of this research is to explore the support of continuous implicit communication between individuals and communities.
Sensors make this kind of communication available for the first time
http://readingarchives.blogspot.com/2006/12/war-and-letter-writing.html
In a series of letters written in the last week of May, Paul put pen to paper to bear witness to the apocalyptic misery of Verdun. The frequency and intensity of the letters suggest that he was convinced he would not survive the battle; every letter, written under the grimmest circumstances imaginable, tried to convey something of the unutterable horror of life under constant artillery fire� (p. 103). She also comments about why soldiers sometimes would write more than one letter in a day: �This practice, common to soldiers under especially heavy fire, suggests that when from hour to hour there was little likelihood of survival, each letter would signify that at the moment it was written, at least, the soldier was still alive� (p. 104).
Nearly every interaction we have in modern life creates data streams, from navigating to the store, buying products on our credit cards, to communicating with old friends online. What we search for, where we go, how much power we consume, the money we spend, the miles we drive; all of these pieces of data tell stories of our lives and interactions. Corporations have been acting on this for some time, and have harnessed the data stream available to them to target sales, and maximize profits [target know's you're pregnant]. More recently an increasingly large number of individuals have started tracking their own data for a variety of reasons, from health [patients like me], to curiosity [Feltron report].
Any device that can be used to collect this automatically generated data can be thought of as a sensor. In particular, in my dissertation I will be focusing on mobile sensors as they have the capability to cover a broad portion of a user's daily activity. 
Through the sharing of automatically collected data we can support true implicit communication because no information needs to be thoughtfully crafted by the sending party. Likewise, through clever delivery (such as tactile messages or ambient displays) we can relieve receiver burden, allowing them to easily attend to or ignore data as it come to them, in a similar fashion to how recipients of collocated implicit interactions can modulate their engagement in respect to their interest in the activity of their cohabitants.
Implicit communication is important
we don't support it
Automatically collected data can help
Several dimensions help illuminate where current research and product designs have yet to expand.
Implicit to Explicit   How much effort is required for a successful communication (for both sender and recipient)?
Flat to Hierarchical   What is the social relationship between participants?
Intimate to Public   What is the scale of the interaction, between two people, within a broader community?
Mobile to Situated   Is the communication location dependent or available in a mobile setting?
Mapping these dimensions onto a series of three plots allows for an intuitive visualization of the  interpersonal communication problem space. In the Figure~\ref{fig:space   we see how different social relationships map to along the dimensions of hierarchy and tie strength.  Figure~\ref{fig:product   illustrates the current product focus on explicit communication methods. Finally Figure~\ref{fig:research   shows the distribution of research in the space of low to no barrier communication. In this case we see that most research has focused on supporting awareness in small groups and non-mobile installations.

Chapter 2  Chapter 2 Introduces a study conducted to find the background information necessary to learn how people use existing physical and digital objects to maintain a sense of connectedness with distant loved ones. By observing the use of these objects we were able to learn both what kinds of interactions are currently supported and where there might be room for 
Maintaining connection at a distance is a familiar challenge in modern life, as education and employment needs frequently require families and friends to live at a distance. We set out to study how people in this position worked to maintain feelings of connection. 
I conducted a qualitative study in conjunction with researcher Si\^{a  n Lindley of Microsoft Research Cambridge at Cambridge University with first-year university students within two months of their moving away from home [5]. We felt this environment would be especially fruitful because the students had just moved away from their homes and families for the first time and were particularly aware of the trade-offs and choices they were making to stay connected. Our study focused chiefly on ambient forms of connection, looking at meaningful objects and their arrangement in the physical, digital, and cloud spaces. We explored what students chose to bring, what they chose to leave behind, and how their interactions provided a sense of connection with their loved ones. 
We identified 3 ways in which the artifacts underpinned a sense of connection: conveying the character of home, supporting a sense of continuity, and enabling the maintenance of a remote physical presence at home. We also considered how the affordances of objects, such as function and the ability to place, provided opportunities for connection. We then suggested opportunities for the design of digital objects that are informed by our findings, such as supporting the curation of collections that are collectively owned, and creating digital displays that acknowledge provenance. 
how transition from home to school heightened awareness of how to keep
figure from cambridge study
fig:cam-comic   For many objects we found that a sense of connection was experience through their usage, such as with wearing a hand-me-down bathrobe that retained the scent of a mother's perfume, or making tea with the old family kettle. In other cases strategic positioning of objects played a key role in connection with important photos place above a workspace or next to one's pillow. Placement on the large scale also mattered, with some objects purposefully left at home allowing students to maintain a presence there as well. We explored how the properties we observed in these physical objects might be used to inform technical designs, and how the designs of existing digital artifacts helped or hindered their usage.  
Chapter 3  Chapter 3 gives an in depth look into a system we developed to support feelings of connectedness for long distance couples. CoupleVIBE provides a eyes-free, hands-free backchannel that couples can use to stay in sync with one another despite distance.
As the new student study confirmed, both explicit and implicit connections support the needs of people living at a distance. These two types of interactions are complimentary to one another providing a more complete feeling of connection in human relationships [8]. However, as most modern communication technologies focus on explicit communication, less is known of how technology can support implicit interactions. I therefore designed, built, and deployed the CoupleVIBE system to explore how mobile technology could be used to support implicit connection at a distance. CoupleVIBE is designed for romantic couples and is a system that supports eyes-free, hands-free location sharing. Through the study of CoupleVIBE we found that implicit messaging channels have unique properties that can better address some communication needs of long-distance couples. 
One leading design guideline was to avoid generating feelings of reciprocity, which would cause users to feel the need to respond to messages received from their partner. To accomplish this I designed the CoupleVIBE system automatically recognizes and pushes a user's location-information to her partner's mobile phone, and delivers the message via vibrotactile cues. This end-to-end automation allowed for partners to learn about one another without engaging in purposeful communication actions and was found to nicely supplement other forms of communication. Privacy is a key concern raised by this kind of automation, and in the design and deployment of the devices I was careful to include and explain mechanisms that allowed for users to control, and if desired, turn off sharing. One of the most interesting outcomes of the study was that although the privacy features were not used to hide activity, they were used as a mechanism for showing respect to remote partners. For example, participants in different time zones would turn off sharing when they knew their partner to be asleep so that they wouldn't buzz their phone and wake them up. Although I did not initially set out to design a respect-centered interface, through the observations of usage I realized that designing mechanisms for showing respect are an important and  overlooked aspect of technical communication. This finding has many applications most notably in the social network space where very little has been done to explore how interfaces can support respectful actions.

The end-to-end automation proved to provide an extremely lightweight communication channel, and supported feelings of connection without generating feelings of reciprocity (a requisite for true implicit communication  
Chapter 4  Chapter 4 introduces CitiSense, a real-time mobile air-quality sensor for novice users. In this chapter we explore how access to sensor data can empower users in their individual choices and encourage feelings of connectedness with their communities. Although our deployment was only one month long, our interviews suggest increase in interest in political activism and engagement with their local communities based on the sensor data collected. 
Sharing and connecting becomes increasingly complicated as we start to include larger groups of people. Despite this challenge, it is still very important to look at supporting connection in larger groups because feeling connected to one's community is an important aspect of wellbeing. To look at supporting communities, I worked with an interdisciplinary team to help design, build, and deploy the CitiSense mobile air quality system [3][4]. This work is motivated on numerous levels, as in addition to supporting connection in communities, poor air quality is a growing global concern that impacts millions of people worldwide. Air pollution is linked with increases in heart attacks, asthma, dementia, and cancer, as well as reduced quality of life for people who live in highly polluted areas. Although we are beginning to understand the health impacts of air pollution, it remains a challenge to provide people with the information they need to make health-conscious choices, both at the personal and community. We designed CitiSense to provide individuals the real-time tools they need to be able to identify when and where they are exposed to poor air. 
In the course of the CitiSense Study I have deployed the system with a total of 40 participants, all using the system within the context of their everyday lives. Through these deployments I learned how people reasoned about air quality data and how having access to the system influenced their interactions with others. One major finding was the interest our users had in sharing their readings, saying that this was the first time they had used technology that made them want to engage with others, in contrast to other mobile technologies that they often used as a social retreat.

Chapter 5  Chapter 5 builds on the ideas from these previous projects, and explores future research goals that expand upon the space of meaningful data sharing to include very large networks. In this chapter I propose the idea of Interpersonal Informatics [1], an area that builds on my previous work and on Ian Li's Personal Informatics [9] to include larger social groups to gain insight on one's self and community.
fig:ipi-comic   Interpersonal Informatics (IPI) can be used to show people the positive and negative influences they are exposed to through their community. This knowledge can help people find way to connect by making shared interests visible, and could also help users become aware of possible negative influences. There are many open challenges, such as how to visualize data, how to respect privacy, and how to track contagions as they spread through networks.
