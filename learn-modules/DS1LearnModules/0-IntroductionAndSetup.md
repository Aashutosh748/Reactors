# Introduction to Python for Data Science
Welcome to the Introduction to Python for Data Science learning path! The content in this learning path pairs with in-person [Microsoft Reactors workshops](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/) but are standalone learning resources--you don't need to attend a workshop to benefit from this learning path.

Throughout this learning path, you are encouraged to test Python code in Visual Studio Code using the Python extension and Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Set up your environment
For the most effective learning, you should set up your environment so that you can follow along wiht the lessons. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is a free download that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. 
2. Download and install the [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). During the install, you will first install a supported version of Python.
3. Activate the [Anaconda environment in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) so that you can run Jupyter Notebooks.
4. Clone TBD.

## Test your environment
If you have successfully set up your environment with Visual Studio Code, Python, and Anaconda, you should be able to run a Jupyter Notebook inside of Visual Studio Code.

Open the cloned repo TBD

## Work the steps yourself
As you're working through this learning path, you are encouraged to try the code. You can use the files you cloned to do this.
