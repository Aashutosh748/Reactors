# Welcome to the Microsoft Reactor Artificial Intelligence Workshop

We're glad you're here!

## What to expect

This will be a one-day, expert led session where you'll explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) and [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/), how to integrate AI into your applications, when to create your own Machine Learning (ML) models, all by walking through a set of examples built on [Python](https://python.org).

## Prerequisites

### Programming skills

The course does assume you are familiar with a programming language, such as Java, Ruby, or C#. We will be using Python, but no Python experience is required. We chose Python because it's an extremely popular language, especially in this space, and it's one whose syntax is relatively readable. We have provided a [primer on Python](./intro-python.md) and [Flask](./intro-flask.md) (which we use for the website you'll be creating) to help get you started.

We make no assumptions about your level of knowledge when it comes to AI or ML. This course is built assuming you're curious about this emerging technology, but haven't necessarily experienced it first hand. Or maybe you're already using similar services on another cloud provider and want to explore Microsoft's offerings.

### System requirements

If you wish to follow along with the exercises you will need a system configured with the following:

- [Python](https://python.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

#### Options for completing the exercises

- If you already have the above installed, you can [grab the starter site](install-starter.md) and you're ready to go!
- If you don't have the above installed, you can [walkthrough the setup process](setup.md) and use your own system.
- If you don't wish to update your system, you can [create a virtual machine on Azure](./dsvm.md) with the prerequisites already installed.
