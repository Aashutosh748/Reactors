3. Reuters Introduction
   1. Global News Org
   2. Founded 1851 - London Based
4. Reuters wanted to enhance its news readers’ experience and generate more value from its visual assets, it used Microsoft Azure Machine Learning to build a video recommendation engine
   1. Automated matching increased engagement

7. > “We get a very short amount of time to capitalize on eyeballs,” says Isaac Showman, Managing Director at Reuters Consumer. “We wanted to create a better experience for site visitors and generate more value from our video assets.”
8. To create matches, the recommendation engine pulls article and video titles, descriptions, and transcripts into Azure SQL Database. It uses the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service and some Python open-source packages to extract tags, such as topic, location, time, and other relevance criteria. Then it uses components in Azure Machine Learning to generate candidate article/video pairs, scored from zero (not relevant), to one (good match), or two (exact match).
9. Integrating Azure ML, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Web-Apps Services gives reuters customers a much better experience
