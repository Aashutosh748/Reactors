# Instructor Notes

1. Data and importance, introduction
2. Cover breakthroughs
   1. using AI to explore new phyical areas where humans can't survive
   2. food science - fungus/food safety
   3. doctors/tumors/pattern recog
   4. farmers - increased crops/reduce resource use
   5. help people with who have different abilities
   6. find manufacturing defects/processes
3. Think about this: Deep inside the Earth, miles down in many cases, rock-sealed pockets hold buried treasures.
4. These hydrocarbon reservoirs are packed with organic compounds that make the world go ‘round. When the contents are extracted and refined, the resulting oil and gas help light cities, transport people and run industries. For some engineers at BP, Job One is locating the reservoirs. Job Two is accurately predicting what percentage of hydrocarbons are retrievable, also known as “recovery factor.” 
5. Remove human bias in algorithm creation
6. trying six/seven algorithms on a problem can take weeks.
7. BP uses Azure ML to reduce the time needed to pinpoint prediction models while boosting the productivity of its data scientists
8. Automated Machine Learning empowers customers to identify an end-to-end, machine-learning pipeline for any problem.
9. This workshop addresses the shortages in Data Science workforce
10. We asked Manish Naik, BP’s head of digital innovation, what ways he foresees Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the cloud further reshaping the oil and gas industry? **MANISH NAIK:** ”Oil and gas companies across the value chain – from exploration to retail – generate significant amounts of data. This means there are lots of opportunities to exploit this data using AI, ML and cloud technologies.
11. Everyone should care
12. Data Science is relevant in all industries
13. We will learn Python and Jupyter Notebooks, and some other tools.
14. This is a taste of what it is like to be a data scientist
15. You will be able to pursue other certifications for Microsoft Azure
16. Acquire deeper skills in data science
