3. Elasticloud Introduction
   1. London based data science consultants
   2. Combine AI/Advanced Analytics/ML
4. Elasticloud built Elasticloud Energy BSUoS Forcast Service
   1. Helps energy providers avoid incurring national fees
   2. providers can predict better energy prices, and smarter energy system
5. We harnessed coal 300,000 years aga
   1. We are looking to burn less
   2. Generate more clean energy
6. Working with UK to reduce carbon emissions
7. UK during the summer is almost entirely low carbon
   1. Microsoft teamed up with energy providers in the UK and Elasticloud
   2. >“We wanted to combine AI, advanced analytics, and machine learning to gather data from multiple sources, support an API, and continually model, train, score, and analyze forecasting algorithms,” says Cross. “And we wanted technology that wouldn’t create infrastructure drama. Azure Machine Learning service checked all the boxes.”
8. [Go over a couple of the Services] Service is built on Azure Kubernetes ML Service, Azure Functions, Azure Data Lake, Azure DevOps, Azure SQL Database
9. This workshop addresses the shortages in Data Science workforce
10. This is a "transformational period in energy." Demand for alternate energy is increasing.
11. >“We’re using Azure and BSUoS Forecast to replace energy levies and subsidies with a smarter grid and a better future for humanity,” says Cross.
12. Everyone should care
13. Data Science is relevant in all industries
14. We will learn Python and Jupyter Notebooks, and some other tools.
15. This is a taste of what it is like to be a data scientist
16. You will be able to pursue other certifications for Microsoft Azure
17. Acquire deeper skills in data science
