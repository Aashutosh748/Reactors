THIS DIRECTORY IS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.

The instructions for this exercise are available in the slides, but
are copied here for your convenience.

- Use either ‘truffle init’ or VS Code to create a new Solidity
  project in the exercise-3 directory

- You can use a text editor and truffle develop or VS Code and Ganache
  to deploy the contracts

- Add the Bank contract from the slides in the contracts directory

- Add a migration for the Bank contract to the migrations directory

- Add a test to test this contract in the test directory (you can copy
  the test from the slides if necessary)

- You can use either ’truffle test’ or ‘truffle develop’ (and then run
  ‘test’ from the workspace)

- If you get stuck, you can find a working version in the exercise-4
  directory (or the solutions directory) but try to make it work
  before looking in those places.
