# Updated Main Branch Name

Please note that the main branch is now titled `main`. Please make sure all of your pull requests are targeting `main` and that you are pulling from `main`. You can reference Scott Hanselman's blog for [more information about using a main branch with Git and GitHub](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx).

# Microsoft Reactor Workshops

**Update:** Due to the concerns surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, we have temporarily suspended programming and events in all Reactor locations as the health and safety of our community and employees is our top priority. We are now offering online learning opportunities for our current content. For more information about online events refer to:
- [Reactor website](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/)
- [Reactor Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/pro/microsoft-reactor)
- [Reactor Twitter](https://twitter.com/msftreactor)

Welcome to Microsoft's Reactor Workshop Content Repository!

In this repo you will find various resources for workshops that Microsoft runs around the world in each of the Reactor locations. If you find any errors or have ideas for improvements, we welcome you to contribute to this repo by opening a PR.

## TODO
These are things I don't want to forget to clean up:
- We need to update aka links to point to the new directories. In general, all of them will be outdated because we've updated the main branch to be called `main`:
  - aka.ms/Reactors_Online 
  - aka.ms/ReactorsDS_Python (Currently doesn't point to anything)
- We need to update links on the YouTube descriptions:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOUh1kgNY-4
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNE-x3h642g
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20xp7KRPGXE
- Did not finish double checking these.
