# Welcome to the Microsoft Reactor Artificial Intelligence Workshop!

We're glad you're here!

## What to expect

This will be a one-day, expert-led session where you'll explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) and [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/), how to integrate AI into your applications, and when to create your own Machine Learning (ML) models. We'll do this by walking through a set of examples built on [Python](https://python.org).

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you are familiar with a programming language, such as Java, Ruby, or C#. We will be using Python, but no Python experience is required. We chose Python because it's an extremely popular language--especially in this space--and its syntax is relatively readable. To get you started, we have provided a [primer on Python](./intro-python.md) and [Flask](./intro-flask.md) (which we will use for the website you'll be creating).

We make no assumptions about your level of knowledge about AI or ML. This course assumes you're curious about these technologies but haven't necessarily experienced it first hand. Or maybe you're using similar services on another cloud provider and want to explore Microsoft's offerings.

## Setup

If you wish to follow along, there are a few steps you'll need to complete to configure your system. We've got a full [setup guide](./setup.md) for you to use!
