Create a CryptoGameItem using ERC-721 Non-Fungible Tokens
---------------------------------------------------------

Create a non-fungible ERC-721 to represent a Crypto [GameItem](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc721) using the OpenZeppelin ERC721.

A fungible token represents an asset that can be exchanged for any other asset of equal value in its class.

-   A currency is an example of a fungible asset. A $100 bill is equal to any other $100 bill, you can freely exchange these bills with one another because they have the same value, no matter the serial number on the specific $100 bill. They are fungible bills.

-   A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a unique token. So collectible items are non-fungible assets, and can be represented by NFTs using [ERC721](http://erc721.org) token, VS Code and the TruffleSuite.

-   Create a directory and unbox drizzle.

-   Create a simple Dapp using the GameItem sample code with the Open Zeppelin 721 libraries and Drizzle.

ERC-721 was the first standard, and currently still the most popular standard, for representing non-fungible digital assets. The most important properties for this kind of asset is to have a way to check who owns what and a way to move things around.
