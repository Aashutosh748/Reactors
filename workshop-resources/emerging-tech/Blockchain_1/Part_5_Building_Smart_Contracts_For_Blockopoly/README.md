# Part 5. Building Smart Contracts for Blockopoly

Our sample application is a fun variation on a famous board game. The
main idea maps well to blockchain systems. We are going to
build portions of the game as part of our exercises.

1. Start by completing the [Bank contract](Building_Blockopoly/BankContract/README.md).
2. Then complete the [AssetManager contract](Building_Blockopoly/AssetManagerContract/README.md).
3. Finish with the [Banker contract](Building_Blockopoly/BankerContract/README.md).
