# Instructions

### Goal
This directory contains the Bank contract from the previous exercise, along with most of the AssetManager contract as well as a migration and a
test. You will need to complete some details to make the tests pass.

### Steps
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
  - If you don't have
  truffle or truffle-assertions installed globally, you will need to
  add them here as well (`npm install -g truffle` and `npm install -g
  truffle-assertions`).

2. Run `truffle compile`. There should be no compilation errors.

3. Run `truffle develop`, and then run the `test` command. You should see
  one or more errors. To fix them, look for TODO indicators in the
  **contracts/AssetManager.sol** file. These will help you figure out what
  is required to make the tests pass.

**Note:** Solutions exist in [BankerContract](../BankerContract/) or in the [Completed_Solutions directory](../../../Completed_Solutions)

4. When you are ready, you can complete the [Banker contract](../BankerContract/README.md).
