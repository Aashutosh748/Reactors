## Helpful tip

In previous sections, you learned how you could adjust an image's width and height using this code:

`<img src=""; width=___ height=___>`

Now that you are learning CSS, please do NOT add width or height directly in the image tag. Instead, add these attributes in your CSS file. Similarly, for HTML tags you have used in the past (such as `<b>` or `<u>`), please stop using HTML tags to determine whether something is bolded or underlined. These attributes should be defined in CSS only.
