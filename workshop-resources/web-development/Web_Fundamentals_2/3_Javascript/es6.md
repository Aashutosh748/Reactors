# ECMAScript and ES6

This section is a primer on the background of JavaScript. By learning some history of the language, you can better understand the importance of ECMAScript and ES6. As the primary front end scripting language of the internet, JavaScript is a massive iceberg of information: not all of it is visible from the surface. Understanding how the language was createdÂ will better your growth as a JavaScript developer.

## What's in a name

This might come as a surprise, but JavaScript wasn't always called JavaScript. During development, it was called Mocha. After the first beta release, the name was changed to LiveScript. Not too long after, a certain browser vendor called Netscape decided to again rename the language to JavaScript, feeding off of the success of the popular language Java.

Fast forward a couple decades, and now even the name JavaScript doesn't tell the whole story. To truly understand the JavaScript landscape, you need to understand how the language is standardized.

## Enter ECMAScript

Nowadays, JavaScript is the *de facto* front end scripting language of the internet. It's an incredibly widespread technology that has to work consistently across all the major browsers and interpreters. Due to this, JavaScript needed a formal process to further the language without alienating browser vendors, users, or developers. The end result is a sort of 'master reference' that the JavaScript interpreters use to understand JavaScript. This is the standardization.

The European Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA) maintains the current standardization of JavaScript, which is called ECMAScript. The name ECMAScript, oftentimes shortened to ES, resulted as a compromise amongst the different organizations involved in the specification process.

For developers, the takeaways are quite simple:

- ECMAScript is the standardization of JavaScript.
- JavaScript is the implementation of the ECMA standard.

Most of the JavaScript you've been exposed to is a version of the standard called ES5, standardized in 2009 and sometimes called ECMAScript 5.

## ES6 and beyond

ES2015, or ES6, is the newest standard. It is a superset of ES5, meaning it contains the features of ES5 plus the additions in ES6. This is a common theme for JavaScript standardizations, where new standards are often included as a superset of the old version, rarely deprecating features.

## Summary

- ES6 is a superset of ES5. Because ES6 is not a full language in itself, you must learn both.
- The majority of existing JavaScript is ES5, including libraries, legacy code bases, and examples you encounter on the web.
- Many of ES6's most important features are syntactic sugar: not necessarily needed, but they make the language sweeter to write.
- JavaScript is the language, ECMAScript is the standard.
- You will learn ES5 and ES6 in parallel, with the new ES6 features clearly marked.
