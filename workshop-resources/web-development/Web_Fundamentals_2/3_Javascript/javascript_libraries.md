# JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks

The web today is a dynamic place that heavily relies on JavaScript to make things happen in web pages. So how do web developers create fancy carousels, slideshows, and other great functionality that are used on the internet?

## JavaScript libraries make adding functionality to websites easier

Ever wonder how developers create tools to display images and slideshows? It is possible that when you view two slideshows on two different websites, the developers who maintain those websites are writing unique code. However, more likely, they re-used code that another programmer wrote and saved in a file that they shared online.

In JavaScript, code is shared using libraries. **A library is a JavaScript file that contains many functions**, and those functions accomplish tasks for your website.

How do you know what's in a specific library? Is there an index? You could look at the JavaScript file, if it's short, or better, you could look at the documentation. Most libraries have documentation containing a list of available functions or a real-world examples.

When a developer creates a publicly-available JavaScript library, it generally means they also put effort into creating documentation and examples. Perhaps one day you will decide to create a library that you find useful and contribute to the developer community.

There are always new JavaScript libraries being created, so you should check them for validity before you use them to write code.

Here are some popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks that are currently (January 2020) being used:

- NodeJS: Node.js or Node JS is a powerful JavaScript framework that allows you to develop a server-side component using JavaScript.
- ReactJS: React is Facebook's component-based web development framework for making UIs and offering declarative views, which makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.
- VueJS: Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, similar to React.
- jQuery: JQuery is probably the most popular JavaScript library that provides many features for modern-day development.
- Angular: Angular, previously known as Angular JS, is a single web development framework developed by Google for both desktop and mobile web applications.

You can use the jQuery API for event handling, animation, and manipulating an HTML document, also known as Document Object Model (DOM). In addition, jQuery is being used in other web building tools like React and Angular. In short, jQuery is a must-know JavaScript library for web development. You'll use jQuery more in the next section as you build your Capstone project.
