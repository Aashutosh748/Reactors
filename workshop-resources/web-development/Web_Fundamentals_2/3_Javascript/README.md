# Part 3. JavaScript

JavaScript is the programming language of browsers. It's how you can incorporate interactivity into your pages, respond to user input, and communicate with the server. It's also one of the best programming languages to begin with because you can build many types of applications with it, and many of the programming constructs you'll learn are similar to other languages.
