# What Does "Full Stack" Mean?

A full stack web developer is someone who can create web applications from start to finish on both the "front end" and "back end" of a web application. The term is vague, so let's add context. A web programmer/developer must know more than how to work with one technology or language. Employers today want skills that go beyond mastering HTML and CSS. Developers need to know how to program browsers, servers, and databases.

## The front end

The front end, also referred to as the **client-side**, is where the user interacts with your web application--you are looking at the front end right now! Remember that no matter what language you are using on the back end, **front end development will always use the same three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.** So whether you are building a website using Ruby on Rails, Python with Django, or PHP with CodeIgniter, the front end portion of your application will always be HTML, CSS, or JavaScript! However, keep in mind that front end development is not only writing markup text with some styling. JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS, and BackboneJS require a lot of code and allow front end developers to create extremely complex, interactive, and dynamic web applications!

## The back end

The back End, also referred to as the **server-side**, is where most of your logic will live. We know a bit about the **Request and Response Cycle**, so you probably know that a client accesses a web page by first requesting content. The server then accepts the request and responds with the appropriate content. All activity that occurs between the accepted request and the delivered response on the **server-side** is called back end development! Python, Ruby, and PHP are some examples of commonly-used back end languages. One of the main concerns of back end development will be retrieving data to return to the client. So where are we getting that data from? And how are we getting it? Well, the database, of course!

## The database

The database is the final component of full stack development. The database is simply a collection of information that is organized to be easily be accessed, managed, and updated. When you register an account for a new website or mobile application, you are essentially **creating a new entry** in that application's database. If you decide to update your password, you are essentially **updating the password column** in that application's database. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for making interactive queries from a database. There are relational databases, non-relational databases, NoSQL databases, and Object Relational Mappings (ORMs).

If you still need a code editor, [install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## What you've learned

In this section, we broke down what a full stack is and what it means to work on the front and back ends of a web application. We also discussed databases and how they connect with the other components of a typical web application. Additionally, we learned about ERD diagrams and how we can use them to design our databases.
